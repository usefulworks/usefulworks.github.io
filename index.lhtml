        <h2>Growing Pains Are Real</h2>
        <p>Growth is good &hyphen; but it&apos;s rarely smooth. It would be nice to build up bit by
           bit, when you're ready for it. But in real life, it tends to happen in bursts.</p>
        <p>Maybe you win a new, massive contract. You finally get your ground-breaking new
           product line to market, get the investment you&apos;ve been looking for, or secure
           gleaming new premises. You have to hire a new sales team (or support staff) to
           keep up. It's everything you've been working towards &hyphen; but it&apos;s sooner,
           or bigger, or more complicated than you thought.</p>
        <h3>It&apos;s not how much you grow. It&apos;s how well you handle growth.</h3>
        <p>It&apos;s vital to be able to take growth in your stride &hyphen; but that&apos;s a
           skill in itself. You&apos;re good at what you do &hyphen; but now it&apos;s time to
           prepare for new challenges. Or maybe you&apos;re in the middle of them right now,
           and need a roadmap through.</p>
        <p>Learning how to integrate new methods, new places, new people. Replacing old systems
           without disrupting day-to-day business. Working out what to do next &hyphen; including
           the best way to spend your new money.</p>
        <p>What you need is guidance to eliminate &hyphen; or avoid &hyphen; growing pains.
           Useful Works offers business consultancy services on how to make the next step count.
           You don&apos;t need theories, philosophies, or hints and tips. You need real&hyphen;
           world insight, practical advice and help with useful action.</p>
